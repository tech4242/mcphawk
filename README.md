# mcp-shark ü¶à

mcp-shark is a passive sniffer for **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** traffic, similar to Wireshark but MCP-focused.

It captures JSON-RPC traffic between MCP clients and WebSocket/TCP-based MCP servers. MCP-Shark can reconstruct full JSON-RPC messages from raw TCP traffic without requiring a handshake.

## What it is
Passive network sniffer for MCP/JSON-RPC traffic (like Wireshark, but protocol-focused).
Captures traffic ‚Äúon the wire‚Äù between any MCP client and server‚Äîdoes not require client/server modification.
Records real traffic (from any tool, agent, or LLM) as it actually flows over TCP/WebSocket.
Web dashboard for live and historical log viewing.
CLI for running as a standalone process.
No proxying or protocol injection‚Äîjust observes real traffic.

## mcpinspector vs. mcp-shark

If you want to observe all MCP traffic between any processes, mcp-shark offers unique value as a passive sniffer that mcpinspector does not. If you want to actively test servers, mcpinspector is better. For many workflows, they are complementary tools.
