# mcp-shark ü¶à

mcp-shark is a passive sniffer for **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** traffic, similar to Wireshark but MCP-focused.

It captures JSON-RPC traffic between MCP clients and WebSocket/TCP-based MCP servers. MCP-Shark can reconstruct full JSON-RPC messages from raw TCP traffic without requiring a handshake.

## What it is
Passive network sniffer for MCP/JSON-RPC traffic (like Wireshark, but protocol-focused).
Captures traffic "on the wire" between any MCP client and server‚Äîdoes not require client/server modification.
Records real traffic (from any tool, agent, or LLM) as it actually flows over TCP/WebSocket.
Web dashboard for live and historical log viewing with proper JSON-RPC message type detection.
CLI for running as a standalone process or with web UI.
No proxying or protocol injection‚Äîjust observes real traffic.

## Features

- **Proper JSON-RPC 2.0 message type detection**:
  - Requests (method + id)
  - Responses (result/error + id)
  - Notifications (method without id)
  - Error responses
- **Chronological message display** - messages shown in order as captured
- **Message filtering** - view all, requests only, responses only, or notifications only
- **Optional ID-based pairing visualization** - see which requests and responses belong together
- **Real-time statistics** - message counts by type
- **Console-only mode** - use `mcp-shark sniff` for terminal output without web UI

## mcpinspector vs. mcp-shark

If you want to observe all MCP traffic between any processes, mcp-shark offers unique value as a passive sniffer that mcpinspector does not. If you want to actively test servers, mcpinspector is better. For many workflows, they are complementary tools.
