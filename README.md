# mcp-shark ðŸ¦ˆ

mcp-shark is a passive sniffer for **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** traffic, similar to Wireshark but MCP-focused.

It captures JSON-RPC traffic between MCP clients and WebSocket/TCP-based MCP servers. MCP-Shark can reconstruct full JSON-RPC messages from raw TCP traffic without requiring a handshake.
